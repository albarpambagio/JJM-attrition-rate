## 📊 Project Summary

### Data Source
- The employee attrition dataset used in this project is sourced from [Dicoding Academy Employee Dataset](https://github.com/dicodingacademy/dicoding_dataset/tree/main/employee).

### Data Preparation & EDA
- The dataset is split into a **modeling set (80%)** for all cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, and model development, and an **inference set (20%)** held out to simulate new/unseen employee data for deployment.
- Extensive data validation, cleaning, and type casting are performed on the modeling set only, with new features engineered for interpretability and predictive power (e.g., AgeGroup, TenureRatio, OverallSatisfaction, PromotionRate).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) includes interactive visualizations of attrition by department, job role, age group, and satisfaction distributions.
- The inference set is only minimally processed to avoid data leakage.
- [Full details in docs/data_preparation_and_eda.md](docs/data_preparation_and_eda.md)

### Model Experimentation & Results
- Multiple models were benchmarked; **linear models (LDA, Ridge, Logistic Regression)** achieved the best recall (~67%) for attrition detection, while tree models had higher accuracy but much lower recall.
- The final tuned LDA model (after improved data prep) achieved:
  - **Accuracy:** 0.72
  - **AUC:** 0.72
  - **Recall:** 0.63
  - **Precision:** 0.32
  - **F1:** 0.43
- Ensembling and stacking did not improve recall; blending increased accuracy but reduced recall.
- The workflow with a held-out inference set provides a realistic, production-ready evaluation.
- [Full details in docs/attrition_experimentation.md](docs/attrition_experimentation.md)

### Feature Importance Analysis
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** values are used to understand feature importance and model predictions:
  - Global feature importance shows which factors most influence attrition predictions
  - Feature importance scores are saved in `results/shap_feature_importance.csv`
  - Top features are used to create the Metabase dashboard for monitoring
- Key findings from SHAP analysis:
  - Work-life balance and job satisfaction are strong predictors of attrition
  - Age and tenure ratios provide important context for attrition risk
  - Department and job role interactions reveal patterns in employee retention
- The analysis helps identify actionable insights for HR interventions
- [Full details in docs/attrition_experimentation.md](docs/attrition_experimentation.md)

### Future Works
- For a robust, production-ready deployment, the following are recommended:
  - Input validation (check for missing columns, correct dtypes, etc.)
  - Error handling (bad input, model load errors, etc.)
  - Logging and monitoring
  - Security (authentication, rate limiting, etc.)
  - API endpoint documentation
- [See todo.md for detailed planned improvements](todo.md)

## 🚀 API Deployment & Usage

### 1. Install Requirements
Make sure you have all dependencies installed (ideally in a virtual environment):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the API Server
Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:
```bash
uvicorn api:app --reload
```
- The API will be available at: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

### 3. Example: Predict Attrition
#### Endpoint
`POST /predict`

## 📄 More Information
- The API applies all feature engineering and preprocessing steps as in model training.
- For more details, see the code in `api.py` and the modules in `src/`.

## Updated Workflow for Attrition Analysis

1. **Run Analysis Scripts**: Use `run_all.py` to execute the data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, and inference scripts in sequence. This will generate all necessary intermediate and final output files.

2. **SHAP Feature Importance**: After modeling, SHAP values are calculated to determine the most important features influencing attrition predictions. The results are saved in `results/shap_feature_importance.csv`.

3. **Prepare Data for Dashboarding**: The `src/metabase_prep.py` script selects the top SHAP features and creates a SQLite database (`results/feature_monitor.db`) containing only these features and the target variable.

4. **Metabase Dashboard**: Connect Metabase to the SQLite database and use the `shap_selected_features` table as the basis for your dashboard visualizations. This ensures the dashboard focuses on the most impactful factors for attrition. See [Metabase Setup Guide](docs/metabase_setup.md) for detailed instructions.
